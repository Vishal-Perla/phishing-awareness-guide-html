# 📩 Phishing Response Guide (HTML Template)

This is an HTML-based phishing awareness and response guide I developed while working as an IT Support Technician at UC Santa Cruz.

We frequently receive reports from faculty, staff, and students who fall for phishing scams, fake job offers, and impersonation emails. To address this, I created a clear and reusable HTML template that could be deployed directly in ServiceNow or email replies to help users respond effectively and stay vigilant.

## 📊 Impact & Use
- ✅ Deployed across 300+ phishing-related support tickets
- 🧑‍🏫 Used by staff to educate new students and elderly affiliates
- 🛡️ Helped reduce repeat phishing incidents by providing real-time, contextual advice and UCSC-verified resources

## 💡 Features
- Clear explanations of common phishing tactics
- Direct links to relevant UCSC Knowledge Base articles
- Trusted security resources like the Phish Bowl and scam awareness pages
- Friendly tone designed for non-technical users

This project is part of my broader effort to make cybersecurity training and support more human, visual, and actionable. Especially for those most vulnerable to scams.
