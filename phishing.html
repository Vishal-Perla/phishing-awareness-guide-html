<p style="font-weight: 400;">Hello,</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">
  Our campus is frequently targeted by spam and phishing attempts through
  emails, phone calls, and text messages. Many of these scams impersonate our
  UCSC colleagues or pose as job offers, while others mimic trusted services
  like DocuSign and Google Docs. Some are simply unwanted marketing
  communications.
</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">
  Lately, there has been a significant rise in phishing emails aimed at our
  campus community. Scammers are constantly finding new ways to bypass our
  defenses by using different, easily created email addresses using free email
  services, such as Gmail or Yahoo. Other times they are stolen email accounts.
  We urge everyone in the campus community to stay alert and 
  <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/8253?hl=en">report any phishing 
  and spam emails to Google</a>.
</p>

<p><strong>Important Note:</strong></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">
  Sometimes, emails that should be flagged as spam or phishing may still end up
  in your inbox. It’s crucial to remain cautious with every email you receive.
  <strong>UCSC does not verify incoming emails</strong>—we rely on Google’s
  spam filter, which is not perfect. To protect yourself, always double-check
  the sender’s email address instead of relying on the display name, especially
  if the email seems unexpected or suspicious.
